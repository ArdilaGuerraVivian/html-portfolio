<h1>About Me</h1>

<hr />

<p>I am a Modern Language professional, QA Tester, and aspiring developer based in Bogotá, Colombia. </p>

<p>
  I have experience working in multinational companies based in the U.S. across various industries. My background in customer service has made me comfortable collaborating in multicultural and remote environments. I'm currently seeking a new career path that offers opportunities for both professional and personal growth.
</p>

<p>
  Languages are a passion of mine, whether they're spoken or coded. I recently discovered the joy of programming and love learning how things work behind the scenes in technology. My dedication to language learning is so strong that I refuse to lose my Duolingo streak—even during social events!
</p>

<p>
  When I'm not immersed in learning something new, you'll find me reading fantasy novels that transport me to different worlds or spending quality time playing with my dog.
